# Handwriting-recognition
# Introduction
This project builds a handwriting-recognition project (mnist) based on the Python language, its core techniques are machine learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project is able to recognize the numbers from 0 to 9 written by users. 
Users Choose the button1 to `"Generate Pattern"`，press `"M"` to turn to the handwrite mode, press the mouse and move to draw the number pattern(between 0~9). After finishing writing，press `"W"` to turn to the screenshot mode, press the mouse to choose the pattern, then press `"Q"` to quit and back to the list. Then choose the button2 to `"refresh"` and redisplay the pattern and finally choose the button3 to `"recognize"` the number.
